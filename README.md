Steps for creating an e-commerce website

- Laragon
- Wordpress
- Visual Paradigm

My business model starts with:
customer
admin
delivery

Please note that this model is not complete and my own business is a small business with me as admin and taking care of my own stock. That's like what you see in the model, which will see that the admin takes care of both the front of the house and the back of the house.

# Let's start with the first picture:
![customer png](img/customer.png)

The first image will be in the customer section.
My website is not complicated at all. where customers can come in and see the product and place an order with 2 payment channels funnel together One is pay-on-delivery and the second is pay-to-account. If already selected, customers can click to order immediately.

# And in the second section is the admin part:
![admin png](img/admin.png)

As for the admin, it will accept orders from customers who order. By purchasing, it can come in the form of pay-on-delivery or it can come in the form of a transfer as well. Therefore, if looking in the picture, we will see that we will clearly split into 2 channels by using a gateway to divide. and we can see that The first way is to transfer that we will have to check the transfer slip before we prepare and deliver the item itself. And after that it will be in the part of the delivery to the courier. We will have a bill to inform the customer (But we do not specify it in the model that appears here).

# And the last part will be the delivery:
![delivery png](img/delivery.png)

In this last part, we can see that there are not many steps. The delivery company will have a duty to receive products from us, after which they will inspect the product and bring it to the parcel number and finally it will be delivered to the customer who has ordered.

As I said, it's still not 100% complete, but it's enough to see the possibility of doing a small business.

Which we have not yet specified in the model Mainly it will be in the part of tracking the customer's products and the communication between the customer and the courier company.
And here's the final picture of how my business model works (halfway through).
